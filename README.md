# Description
- **Simple racing game** I created with pygame during a school project.
- The **goal** is to make your way aroud the oncoming traffic and get as far as possible, earn money and unlock new cars.
- Currently the difficulty stays the same and new cars are only a cosmetic.
- Maybe Ill work on it more in the future.

# How to play
